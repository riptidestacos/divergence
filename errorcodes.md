    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Divergence Bot is a bot that is functional for every purpose imaginable. Divergence does Administration, Moderation, Games, Music, and more, commands -- most of which are free, but if you wish to purchase better performance, better guild protections, better commands, or the ability to add more commands by our website, then you may do so by going to our website <a href>here (this page is currently not available)</a>.
    </p> 
    <p>This bot is a unique bot that can be controlled fully by commands with a complex built-in collections system that is backed-up by one of our many servers. You can keep your guild feeling safe, secure, and protected by Divergence with our automatic raid protection services, which can be enabled or disabled at any time by using the !enableautoraids or !disableautoraids commands at any time.

# Common Error Codes-editRole:

<p>================= editRole Command Errors =================
    xE0100: This error code occurs when there is no user selected.

    xE0101: This error code occurs when there is no role selected.

    xE0102: This error code occurs when the role you are trying to make someone else is above, or the same as, your own role.

    xE0103: This error code occurs when the role you mention is not mentionable by the guilds settings. Please update this setting, or have your administrator update this setting, in the guild settings to use @role.

    xE0104: This error code occurs when your role is  lower than the role you selected. Make sure you are a higher role than the role you select for this command to work.

    xE0105: This error code occurs when the bots role is lower than the role selected and cannot change the person's role.

    xE0105-cont: Using this command removes the old role if possible and replaces it with the new role. If the old role is not removeable then the new role will be added without the old role being removed. This causes a soft error saying: "Added role: '<@role|roleName>' (Role: <oldRoleName> could not be removed)"
